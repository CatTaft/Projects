This is a collection of projects from my data analytics degree as well as projects I did through the Udacity nanodegree. I will be adding to it continually as I'm working on a machine learning Nanodegree and am beginning my master's in data science.
All the project folders contain the Jupyter notebooks and associated files, and many also contain the HTML download of the original notebooks.

Contents of the folders: 

- DAT 475 - ANOVA, Pareto Analysis - This is a couple of projects from school where I performed ANOVA and Parento analyses to examine product defects in a hypothetical production scenario.

- MAT 303 - Stats 2 - Regression in R - This has two projects and multiple problem sets, each with a report. The entire class was focused on various regression techniques, performed with R.

- Udacity - Data Analytics Nanodegree - There are 4 projects in this folder:
	- Project 2: Impact of Women in the Workforce - this is a visualization project looking at Gapminder data to examine various social and economic metrics across the world to examine the influence of women's workforce participation.
	- Project 3: AB Testing - this was an end to end A/B test of the performance a hypothetical website redesign. It included statistical analyses and logistic regression.
	- Project 4: Data Cleaning - this project involved taking a large amount of tweet data from the twitter account WeRateDogs through the Twitter API, wrangling and cleaning it, combining it with some external data, and performing analyses on the cleaned data.
	- Project 5: Communicate Data Findings - Environmental & Social Factors of Industrialization - for this project I took data from several sources on Kaggle and Gapminder, cleaned and combined it, and performed a thorough analysis examining how various environmental and social metrics changed throughout a country's development.

- ArcGIS - IT 242 Final Project - This project uses ArcGIS to examine population and water table data to develop an evacuation plan for Maricopa County in the event of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant there.
