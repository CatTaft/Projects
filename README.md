This is a collection of projects from my data analytics degree as well as personal projects, and projects I did through the Udacity nanodegree. I will be adding to it continually as I'm focusing more on end to end analytics projects to target skill building and create a portfolio. All the project folders contain the Jupyter notebooks and associated files, and many also contain the HTML download of the original notebooks.

Contents of the folders: 

- DAT 475 - ANOVA, Pareto Analysis - This is a couple of projects from school where I performed ANOVA and Parento analyses to examine product defects in a hypothetical production scenario.
  
- Global Education - This will be an end to end personal project using education data from ourworldindata.org, obtained via Kaggle. It goes through cleaning, EDA with some analysis, and an XGboost and Random Forest model. As of 1/12/24 I've finished the notebook and will be linking the Tableau public dashboard I'm working on and will upload a final report here.

- MAT 303 - Stats 2 - Regression in R - This has two projects and multiple problem sets, each with a report. The entire class was focused on various regression techniques, performed with R.

- Udacity - Data Analytics Nanodegree - There are 4 projects in this folder:
	- Project 2: Impact of Women in the Workforce - this is a visualization project looking at Gapminder data to examine various social and economic metrics across the world to examine the influence of women's workforce participation.
	- Project 3: AB Testing - this was an end to end A/B test of the performance a hypothetical website redesign. It included statistical analyses and logistic regression.
	- Project 4: Data Cleaning - this project involved taking a large amount of tweet data from the twitter account WeRateDogs through the Twitter API, wrangling and cleaning it, combining it with some external data, and performing analyses on the cleaned data. The emphasis of the project was data wrangling but the account is fun so the analysis was fun too.
	- Project 5: Communicate Data Findings - Environmental & Social Factors of Industrialization - for this project I took data from several sources on Kaggle and Gapminder, cleaned and combined it, and performed a thorough analysis examining how various environmental and social metrics changed throughout a country's development. This was a completely self-guided capstone project.

- ArcGIS - IT 242 Final Project - This project uses ArcGIS to examine population and water table data to develop an evacuation plan for Maricopa County in the event of a nuclear accident at the nuclear power plant there.
